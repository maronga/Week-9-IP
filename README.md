Predicting whether a passenger survived the TItanic shipwreck: Python Project IP Week 9 Core

#### {IP WEEK 9 DATA SCIENCE CORE}, {February, 2022}

#### By **{John Maronga}**

## Description

* The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and UCI.

* The data collected focused on both the Titanic ship incident and the Spambase Dataset. 

* Dataset link: The dataset links are in the respective github folder repository
 
* I will act as a Data Scientist to build a model that determines whether or not a passenger survived the incident and if an email was spam or not.


## Experimental Design

* Loading & Viewing the Data
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis:
      - Univariate
      - Bivariate
      - Multivariate
* Feature Engineering
* Modelling:
      - K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes Classifier
* Tuning the best model
* Challenge the solution
* Conclusion

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Google colab/jupyter notebook
* Python basics
* Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit learn)
* Github
